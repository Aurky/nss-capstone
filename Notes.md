* 'Finished' up the create user endpoint and successfully deployed with the current codebase on branch `feature/user-endpoints`
  * Resulted in all 4 tables being created
  * Ran a test local frontend to ensure it still works. - Everything looks good aside from it being for the musicplaylistservice still.

### Saturday 11-11
* Made placeholder html pages that successfully navigate with buttons. No js files were made for functionality. 
  * Just placeholders to make the future work flow more efficiently.
